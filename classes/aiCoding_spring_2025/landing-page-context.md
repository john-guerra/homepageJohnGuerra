## Course Description

This course trains master's level computer science students to become Silicon Valley-ready software engineers in the age of AI. Students will master AI-assisted development tools while maintaining professional engineering standards, learning to build high-quality, production-ready full-stack applications using cutting-edge AI technologies.

Building successful software with AI requires more than good prompting—it demands understanding how Large Language Models work, when to use which tools, how to evaluate AI-generated code systematically, and how to integrate AI into professional development workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:

1. Understand how Large Language Models work and their fundamental capabilities and limitations
2. Master three AI coding modalities and know when to use each appropriately
3. Engineer sophisticated prompts using advanced techniques like chain-of-thought and meta-prompting
4. Implement comprehensive evaluation systems to systematically measure AI code quality
5. Practice Test-Driven Development integrated with CI/CD pipelines for AI-generated code
6. Apply Agile methodologies including Scrum ceremonies and Design Thinking in AI workflows
7. Orchestrate parallel AI agents for complex development tasks
8. Design and deploy three portfolio-worthy full-stack applications demonstrating professional practices

## Key Topics Covered
